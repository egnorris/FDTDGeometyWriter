# FDTD Geometry Writer Ver 1.0 Documentation
FDTDGeometryWriter is a supporting pre-processing library for the [Open Source 3D Finite Difference Time Domain software](https://github.com/FDTD-Lab) maintained in collaboration between The University of Ottawa Computational Nanophotonics Lab [The University of Ottawa Computational Nanophotonics Lab](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/lramunno/) led by Dr. Lora Ramunno and  [Dr. Antonino Calà Lesina's research group at Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.ita.uni-hannover.de/en/institute/team/prof-dr-antonio-cala). The aim of this library is to provide a framework to map image files to the geometry.json system currently supported in this 3D-FDTD Software. 

A [Tutorial](https://egnorris.github.io/FDTDGeometyWriter/Tutorial.html) on what is going on in this library and [Documentation](https://egnorris.github.io/FDTDGeometyWriter/Usage.html) on individual functions are included.
